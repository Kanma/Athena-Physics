- Summary
---------------------------------------

Athena-Physics is one of the modules of the Athena Game Framework, in the form
of a library written in C++.

This module provides concrete implementations of the physical components of the
'entities system' implemented in Athena-Entities. It also contains some
physical-related utility classes.

The physics library used is Bullet (http://bulletproject.org).

The use of this module is optional, you can choose to implement your own
components instead.
