---------------------------------------
- Summary
---------------------------------------

Athena-Physics is one of the modules of the Athena Game Framework, in the form
of a library written in C++.

This module provides concrete implementations of the physical components of the
'entities system' implemented in Athena-Entities. It also contains some
physical-related utility classes.

The physics library used is Bullet (http://bulletproject.org).

The use of this module is optional, you can choose to implement your own
components instead.


This module can be used as a standalone library, or combined with the rest of
the Athena Game Framework (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Framework).

Additionally, when the Athena-Scripting (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Scripting)
module is built alongside this one, Athena-Physics will be usable from JavaScript.


---------------------------------------
- Dependencies
---------------------------------------

Athena-Physics requires the following dependencies:

   - XMake
   - Athena-Math
   - Athena-Core
   - Athena-Entities
   - Bullet
   - UnitTest++

They are provided as GIT submodules of this repository and will be compiled
automatically during the compilation of Athena-Physics.

To download them, do:

    somewhere$ cd <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-Physics>
    Athena-Physics$ git submodule init
    Athena-Physics$ git submodule update


---------------------------------------
- Compilation
---------------------------------------

(Note: you'll need to install CMake to compile Athena-Physics)

To compile Athena-Physics (and all its dependencies), do:

    somewhere$ mkdir build
    somewhere$ cd build
    build$ cmake <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-Physics>
    build$ make

The library will be put in build/bin/
